# theme-toggler
This is my answer to the theme toggler activity from section 3 of the JavaScript and React for Developers: Master the Essentials Udemy course by Cassidy Williams. 

The objective was to get the style of the website to change when a button was clicked. I used an event listener and a callback to achieve this. 

The course can be found here: ['JavaScript and React for Developers: Master the Essentials'](https://www.udemy.com/js-and-react-for-devs)
